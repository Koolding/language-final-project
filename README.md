# Description
In this last assignment for my portfolio the goal is to see how women are potraited in the newspaper headlines in South Africa from 2005 to 2021.

# Methods
The script analyzes  emotions conveyed in news headlines from South Africa in the time period 2005 to 2021. It loads a dataset of headlines and filters it for articles from South Africa, and classifies the emotions using the classification model 'Huggingface'. It then  visualizes the number of articles per year and the emotion distribution. It also calculates and prints a table containing the normalized emotion distribution.

# Results
Generally, the most dominant emotion for the headlines through the years is neutral. It is notable however that in 2010, the second most conveyed emotion in the headlines from South Africa was joy, whereas in 2021 it shifted to anger. For research purposes it would be interestering to conduct a further inquery regarding the reason for this. 

# What could have been done better
To get a better overview of the outputs created, it would have been advantageous to make a comparative analysis, seeing how e.g the emotion anger has devoloped. Furthermore, one could have compared these findings to one of the other 3 countries in the dataset.
